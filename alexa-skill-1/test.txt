Hi Siddharth,

Our records indicate that you will require immigration support documents in order to join Amazon.

Examples: TN Visa, J1 Visa, work permit, CPT, or EAD Card.

WHAT YOU NEED TO DO:

If you have your documents physically in hand, complete THIS SURVEY using this survey ID: 23531578
Once you have completed the survey, we will update your records. Please do not reply to the email to confirm you have completed the survey unless you continue to get the email reminders.
If you DON'T have your documents physically in hand, please disregard this message.
If you DON'T need immigration support, please take the survey and select the appropiate selection.
You must have documents in hand by THURSDAY (5/7/2020) at 3pm PST in order to start, otherwise your start date will be pushed out. Photos/copies or messages starting documents 'will be delivered' are NOT sufficient.

Please review the FAQs below, and feel free to reach out if there are any additional questions.

FAQs

Q: I want to push my start date out because of delays. What should I do?
A: If you would like to push your start date out due to delays with OPT, EADs, or other immigration documents, please reply directly to this email with your requested new start date. For your reference you can find more information here on current USCIS processing times to help you decide on a new start date.

Q: I decided to push out my start date. How do I know if it is updated?
A: Our team will send you a separate email to confirm your start date has been changed in the system. Please allow 3 - 5 business days to process these requests.

Q: I am expecting my documents to arrive on Friday or over the weekend. Can I start on Monday?
A: Unfortunately, you will need to confirm your documents are in hand by the Thursday deadline. Messaging stating that your documents 'will be delivered' Friday or over the weekend are NOT sufficient. If your documents do not arrive by the Thursday deadline, it will have to be pushed out.

Q: I got my documents earlier than expected. Can I push my start date back?
A: If you wish to push your start date back earlier, you must email our team and confirm your immigration documents are in hand by the Wednesday before at Noon PT. We cannot guarantee all requests can be accommodated, as our team needs to ensure that the rest of your onboarding is finalized and your manager is prepared to have your start.

Q: Can I use the receipt of my EAD card application to start?
A: EAD receipts are only valid if you are replacing a document that was lost, stolen, or damaged. You can find more information here on the USCIS page.



Cheers!
